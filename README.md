📝 Problem Statement

Current chronic disease management platforms are reactive data silos. Patients face fatigue from endless manual logging, while clinicians are overwhelmed with unfiltered data, leading to alert fatigue and missed interventions. Patients are left without predictive support until a crisis occurs.

🎯 Objective

Build a web-based predictive ecosystem that co-manages chronic conditions, leveraging AI to anticipate risks, behavioral nudges to sustain engagement, and community support to empower patients and clinicians.

🚀 Core Features

Predictive Risk Engine – AI-driven Stability Score forecasting risks (e.g., “High probability of a hypertensive episode in 48 hours”).

Context-Aware Nudges – Personalized prompts (stress, diet, lifestyle adjustments).

Closed-Loop Clinician Connect – Secure portal for clinicians with AI-suggested protocols, prescriptions, and video consults.

Community & Peer Support – Forums and moderated groups for shared experiences.

Goal & Progress Dashboard – Visual journey maps for symptoms, medications, lifestyle habits, and long-term progress.
